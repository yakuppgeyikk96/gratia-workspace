Gratia API

I'm developing this project in my spare time to improve my end-to-end full-stack application development and architectural thinking skills. I chose an e-commerce project because it contains complex flows and provides opportunities to challenge myself with diverse business logic.
On the backend, I'm building a REST API using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes JWT-based authentication and an email verification system. I use SendGrid for email delivery.
On the frontend, I'm working with a monorepo architecture using Turborepo. I chose monorepo because I plan to develop a separate CMS application in the future, and both projects will share a common component library. For the component library, I'm using Radix UI + SCSS. Core technologies include Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, and TanStack Query.
